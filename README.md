### 👋 Welcome
I am a **Data Scientist** focused on building reproducible, decision-oriented data products. My work spans the entire lifecycle—from raw data preparation and rigorous statistical analysis to **ML/DL modeling**, **NLP/LLM applications**, and **analytics engineering**.

My foundation is a unique blend of:
* **Quantitative Rigor:** B.Sc. in Mathematics & Science Education.
* **Human-Centered Analysis:** B.A. in Sociology.
* **Systems & Business Thinking:** M.Sc. in Management Information Systems (MIS) including MBA-level coursework.
* **Discipline & Leadership:** Project management (PMI-aligned) and real-world responsibility through high-stakes volunteering in Search & Rescue.

---

### 🚀 Core Focus Areas
* **End-to-End Pipelines:** EDA → Feature Engineering → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment.
* **Advanced Modeling:** Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, Neural Networks, and Model Interpretability.
* **Applied AI:** NLP, LLM Applications (Embeddings, Semantic Search, RAG).
* **Analytics Engineering:** ELT/ETL, warehouse-friendly modeling, and trustworthy KPI layers.
* **Decision Support:** Executive-ready storytelling and stakeholder-aligned BI solutions.
